James Lim - Q1 Personal Project g26

**Project Description**

Anyone who enjoys basketball or playing video games. My application will be a web version of a common arcade/bar game where the player has some allotted(30s-1min) to shoot a basketball into a hoop. When there's ~15s left, the hoop will move either further away or side to side.

edit - was unable to implement a timer, power meter, and the functionality where the hoop moves. underestimated the amount of work for using canvas and collision detection

The output the user needs is just their score (# of made baskets)

The inputs needed are 

1) User lets the game know they are ready to play 

2) Level of power to shoot the ball as indicated by amount of time button is pressed
